**Objective**: The primary goal of this project was to analyze service usage patterns in the San Francisco Bay bike share system to identify rush hours and enhance bike redistribution strategies, ultimately improving overall service usage.

**Process**: I conducted a comprehensive analysis of various features to understand user behaviors based on factors such as month, day, hour, weather conditions, and the most popular trips and stations. Using PostgreSQL, I created, populated, and altered databases and tables, cleaned, structured and analysed the data, employing techniques like JOINs, SUBQUERIES, and numerous arithmetic and conditional statements (e.g., WHERE, LAG () OVER (PARTITION), WITH (), ROLL UP etc.). -- *please see SQL script*
The insights gained from this analysis were then visualized using Power BI to facilitate data-driven decision-making. *PowerBI dashboard link below*
